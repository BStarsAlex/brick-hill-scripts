# brick-hill-scripts
Some scripts I have made for Brick Hill (node-hill).

These scripts are intended to be used with Brick Hill's NodeJS hosting software node-hill.
To use these scripts, put them into your `user-scripts` folder, and follow the instructions provided here for each one.

## Dynamic Pads (dynamicpads.js)
This script enables you to quickly and easily create bricks that change the speed of anyone who touches them.
To create a pad, create any brick named "`speedpad-#`", substituting the number for the speed you would like.
For example, to create a pad that doubles a player's speed, you would name a brick "`speedpad-10`". To make a brick that reverses the effect, name it "`speedpad-5`".
